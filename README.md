# wetgear
need a command router for discordgo? wetgear is framework for routing, and parsing discordgo messages to commands

## why the name?
wetgear kinda sounds like netgear, the company that manufactured most of my home routers, and well since this is a router, just a different kind, i figured that it was a clever name.
