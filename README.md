# wetgear
Need a command router for discordgo? wetgear is framework for routing, and parsing discordgo messages to commands

## Why the name?
wetgear kinda sounds like netgear, the company that manufactured most of my home routers, and well since this is a router, just a different kind, I figured that it was a clever name.

## Where's the documentation?
I will write proper documentation when I get the time, however a quick look at the code should be suffecient for most when it comes to figuring out how to use wetgear.

## Notice
This project currently in it's early stages, so be aware that some fundamental changes to how wetgear works, may change over time.

### TODO
- [x] Use hashmaps rather than slices in Command and Router for holding commands and sub-commands
- [ ] Write better comments and documentation for use with godoc
- [ ] Write basic examples
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Add backtick argument parsing, will add when I need it for my bot.
